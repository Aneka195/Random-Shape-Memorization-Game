Project Title: Random Shape Memorization Game

Project Description: Our webpage will have the following 4 shapes: circle, square, triangle, and rectangle. The user must click on the highlighted version of one of those shapes on the webpage.
The server will highlight the same shape and one new additional shape if the user clicks on the appropriate image. Now, the user must click on those 2 in the proper sequence. The order of the highlighted photos is saved in an array on the server side and the server randomly chooses which random shape will be highlighted.

Project Requirements 

Once website loads up, User will be able to see four shapes on the website
User should be able to click a button on the corner of the page for the rules of the game, if they donâ€™t understand
User will be able to close this rules box once they understand how to play
Usr will be able to see one shape highlighted and only one
User can click on the highlighted version of one of the shapes
User can see if the shape they clicked is correct (Server will highlight the same shape and an additional one if so)
User should be able to click on previous highlighted shape and every new highlighted one after that to put in their guess of the order
If user clicks on the right order of highlighted shapes, the pattern will add on one more highlighted shape every time they get the previous pattern right
If the user clicks it wrong, it will notify them and they will have to start again
User should not receive the same pattern the second time they play as it will be randomized by the server
